# **Book Recommendation App Overview**<br>
This project is a simple book recommendation app built using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.<br> It fetches book details and provides recommendations based on either the author or the genre of a queried book.<br> The app utilizes the Open Library API for all data retrieval.

## **Features**<br>
-Book Search: Allows users to search for books by title or author. <br>
-Recommendations: <br>
--By Author: Recommends other books written by the same author.<br>
--By Genre: Suggests books in the same genre or category. <br>
--Fallback Mechanism: If no similar books by the same author or in the same genre are found, the app recommends a trending book from the Open Library. <br>
--Book Details: Displays the title, author, and cover image (if available) for both the queried book and the recommended books.

## **How It Works**<br>
-User Input: The user is prompted to enter a book title or author.<br>
-API Request: The app sends a request to the Open Library API to retrieve books matching the query.

## **Recommendation Logic:**<br>
-If the user chooses to search by author, the app checks for other books by the same author.<br>
-If the user chooses to search by genre, the app looks for books within the same genre.<br>
-If no similar books are found, the app retrieves a trending book from the Open Library as a fallback.<br>
-Display: The app displays the queried book’s details along with the recommended book(s).

## **Dependencies**<br>
-Python 3.x<br>
-requests<br>
-IPython.display for image display in Jupyter Notebook<br>

## **Challenges & Solutions**<br>
-Duplicate Recommendations: Initially, the app would recommend different editions of the same book. This was fixed by filtering out duplicate titles and editions.<br>
-API Limitations: The Open Library API sometimes returned unrelated books in recommendations. To address this, a fallback mechanism was implemented to recommend trending books when relevant matches weren’t found.<br>
-Error Handling: Added robust error handling to manage API response issues, ensuring the app continues to function smoothly.<br>

**Conclusion**<br>
This project demonstrates the integration of a public API with Python to create a functional and user-friendly book recommendation system. <br> The implementation of fallback mechanisms ensures that users always receive a recommendation, even when direct matches are unavailable.
